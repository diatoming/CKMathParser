# CKMathParser
CKMathParser is a **math expression parser** built with the **Swift 2.0** programming language by Apple Inc.

#### Goals For The Project
* Build a functional math parser framework importable into iOS projects
* Support all of the basic operators (+, *, ^, etc)
* Support major singe parameter functions (sin, cos, log, etc)
* Support major fundamental constants (e, pi, etc) and user defined constants.
* Be easily extensible to add support for more functions and constants
 

Available Operators:


| Operator | Function          | Status              |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| +        | Addition          | Fully functional    |
| -        | Subtraction       | Can not yet negate  |
| *        | Multiply          | Fully functional    |
| /        | Divide            | Fully functional    |
| ^        | Exponentiation    | Not yet implemented |
| (        | Open Parantheses  | Not yet implemented |
| )        | Close Parantheses | Not yet implemented |
| %        | Percent           | Not yet implemented |
